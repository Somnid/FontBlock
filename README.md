FontBlock
=========

Experimental Chrome Extension for blocking font API requests

What is this?
-------------

Typical web usage involves downloading web fonts from a number of providers.  Typically these are charged per view and so to track views on websites the font license mandates the use of tracking calls.  On top of being crazy to change perpetually instead of one upfront licensing cost for what is essentially a single image, as a web user this isn't your problem and your page loads shouldn't be slower and you shouldn't be wasting bandwidth making calls to these websites.  This extension aims to block those calls, disrupting draconian licensing, DRM and wasteful web traffic.
